Explanation:
* Context:
   * Holds a reference to a State object (- behavioral.state: State).
   * Implements a method request() which delegates the action to the current behavioral.state's handle() method.
* State:
   * An interface declaring the handle() method.
* ConcreteStateA and ConcreteStateB:
   * Implement the State interface.
   * Provide specific behaviors for the handle() method.
UML Relationships:
* The Context has an association (<>------->) with the State interface, meaning it holds a reference to a State object.
* ConcreteStateA and ConcreteStateB have inheritance relationships (^) with the State interface, indicating they implement the State interface.
How It Works:
1. Context starts with a default State.
2. When request() is called on the Context, it invokes handle() on its current State object.
3. The current State defines the behavior that occurs in response to the request().
4. The State can optionally change the Context's behavioral.state to a different ConcreteState, altering future behavior.
Visual Representation:
* The arrows represent relationships:
   * The open diamond arrow (<>------->) from Context to State signifies aggregation (Context contains a State).
   * The open triangle arrows (^) from ConcreteStateA and ConcreteStateB to State signify realization (they implement the State interface).
