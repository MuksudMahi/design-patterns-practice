Key Components and Relationships
1. Originator
   * Role: The object whose behavioral.state needs to be saved and restored.
   * Responsibilities:
      * Creates a Memento containing a snapshot of its current internal behavioral.state.
      * Uses the Memento to restore its internal behavioral.state.
   * Relationship:
      * Aggregation with Memento: The Originator creates and uses Mementos.
2. Memento
   * Role: Stores the internal behavioral.state of the Originator.
   * Responsibilities:
      * Keeps the behavioral.state of the Originator confidential.
      * Provides the stored behavioral.state back to the Originator when requested.
   * Relationship:
      * Aggregation from Caretaker: The Caretaker holds and manages Mementos.
      * Association with Originator: Mementos are created and utilized by the Originator.
3. Caretaker
   * Role: Manages the Mementos for the Originator.
   * Responsibilities:
      * Stores Mementos.
      * Retrieves Mementos upon request.
      * Does not modify or examine the contents of Mementos.
   * Relationship:
      * Aggregation with Memento: Holds references to Mementos but doesn't alter them.
