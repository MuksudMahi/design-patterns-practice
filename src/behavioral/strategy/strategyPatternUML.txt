Explanation of the Diagram:
1. Context Class:
   * Name: Context
   * Attributes:
      * - behavioral.strategy: Strategy — The context maintains a reference to a Strategy object.
   * Methods:
      * + setStrategy(s: Strategy) — Allows changing the behavioral.strategy at runtime.
      * + executeStrategy() — Calls the execute() method of the current behavioral.strategy.
2. Strategy Interface:
   * Name: Strategy (denoted with <<interface>> to indicate it's an interface)
   * Methods:
      * + execute(): void — The operation that all concrete strategies will implement.
3. Concrete Strategies:
   * ConcreteStrategyA
      * Implements Strategy.
      * Provides a specific implementation of execute().
   * ConcreteStrategyB
      * Implements Strategy.
      * Offers a different implementation of execute().
   * ConcreteStrategyC
      * Implements Strategy.
      * Yet another implementation of execute().
Relationships:
* Context uses Strategy:
   * The Context class holds a reference to a Strategy object.
   * It delegates the call to the behavioral.strategy's execute() method inside executeStrategy().
* Concrete Strategies implement Strategy:
   * Each ConcreteStrategy class implements the Strategy interface.
   * They provide specific behaviors for the execute() method.
Understanding the Strategy Pattern:
Purpose:
The Strategy Pattern enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable within that family.
Real-World Metaphor:
Imagine you're navigating a city:
* Context: You, needing to get from point A to point B.
* Strategy Interface: The mode of transportation.
* Concrete Strategies:
   * ConcreteStrategyA: Walking.
   * ConcreteStrategyB: Driving.
   * ConcreteStrategyC: Bicycling.
Depending on various factors (time, weather, distance), you can change your mode of transportation dynamically without altering your primary goal: reaching your destination.
